2. Professional management. Funds are managed by professional portfolio managers, giving access to experience and market analysis. It is especially useful for novice investors.
3. Variety of strategies and allocations. There are different types of capitals, such as index, stock, bond and blended, which give investors the opportunity to choose a strategy that suits their goals and risk level.
4. Liquidity. Trusts are often more liquid than individual investments in stocks or bonds. For example, ETF are traded on the Fund of Funds Lp and can be bought and sold throughout the day.

7. Commissions and costs. When investing in a pool of assets, you need to consider management fees, which can vary.
